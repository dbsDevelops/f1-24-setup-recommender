df_sanetizer.py

This script loads a general CSV file (joined from multiple packet types) and creates a sanitized CSV with one record per lap.
Each record contains:
  - The header’s session time and frame identifier (renamed as m_header_sessionTime and m_header_frameIdentifier)
  - Lap data: sector1TimeMS, sector2TimeMS, and sector3TimeMS (renamed as lapData_sector1TimeInMS, etc.)
  - Car setup parameters for the player’s car (from columns beginning with m_carSetups_0_, renamed with prefix carSetups_)

It determines lap candidates by filtering motion packets based on the distance (using only X and Y) to a known start/finish point.
