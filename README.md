## üîç Overview <a id="overview"></a>
This project consists of a recommendation system of EA SPORTS F1 24 car setups for any simracer. This project is a fork of the [Fredrik2002/f1-23-telemetry-application](https://github.com/Fredrik2002/f1-23-telemetry-application) which provides a Python application for the simracer to view telemetry data of their current session. 

## üöÄ Features <a id="features"></a>
- ‚úÖ Title bar displaying session type, laps (or time left if in qualifying), and race status (green, yellow, or red flag, SC, or VSC)
- ‚úÖ Main Menu tab showing different information depending on the session type (Qualifying, Race, Time Trial)
- ‚úÖ Fully functional mini-map displaying the track, car positions, and mini-sectors lighting up under a yellow flag
- ‚úÖ Damage reports (excluding engine and gearbox) for all cars in the session
- ‚úÖ Inner and outer tyre temperatures for all cars
- ‚úÖ Current, best, and last lap times, along with sector times for all cars, depending on the session type
- ‚úÖ ERS & Fuel management information as well as time penalties for all cars
- ‚úÖ Weather forecast for upcoming sessions, including track and air temperature
- ‚úÖ Option to choose the port for receiving data
- ‚úÖ Option to redirect received data to another IP address and port (to share data with a friend or another application)


## üîß Usage <a id="usage"></a>
### <ins>Step 1 : Configure your Virtual Python Enviroment</ins><a id="step1"></a>
1. [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) in your Linux, macOS or Windows system if you don't have it already.
2. Install the required libraries.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
‚ö†Ô∏è If you have any issues in macOS systems importing the tkinter library, you will have to use the [brew package manager](https://brew.sh) to install the following packet:
```bash
brew install python-tk
```
Here is the reference for the issue I was having: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5459444/tkinter-python-may-not-be-configured-for-tk

### <ins>Step 2 : Run the application</ins><a id="step2"></a>

Run *Telemetry.py*
```bash
python3 app/telemetry.py
``` 

### <ins>Step 3 : Send data to the application </ins> <a id="step3"></a>
Open the F1 Game :
- ‚û°Ô∏è Go to Settings 
- ‚û°Ô∏è Telemetry Settings
- ‚û°Ô∏è Make sure the port in-game matches the port used by the application (20777 by default)
- ‚û°Ô∏è **If your game is connected to the same network as your computer running this application**, the easiest way is to enable the <u>UDP Broadcast</u> setting.
**If not**, you have to enter your public IP address in the <u>IP Address</u> setting.
- ‚úÖ You are then good to go!
