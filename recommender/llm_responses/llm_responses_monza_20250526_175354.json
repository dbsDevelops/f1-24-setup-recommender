Since Monza is more similar to Aiguilhe, I'll use that as a starting point.\n\nFirst, looking at the wings: Barcelona has 45 front and 31 rear. Aiguilhe uses 34 front and 30 rear. Maybe I can average these or find a middle ground. Let's say 39 for front and 32 for rear.\n\nNext, differentials. Barcelona is 25 on throttle and 20 off. Aiguilhe has 40 on and 50 off. Since Monza is similar to Aiguilhe, maybe increase the differential more. Let's go with 45 on and 60 off.\n\nCamber: Both have negative values. Barcelona uses -3.5 front and -2.2 rear; Aiguilhe has -3.2 front and -1.8 rear. To balance, I'll average them to around -3.35 front and maybe -2.0 rear for a smoother decrease.\n\nToe: Barcelona is 0 everywhere, while Aiguilhe uses 0.09 front-left and 0.08 front-right. Maybe slight positive toe in the front: 0.1 front and 0.05 rear.\n\nSuspension: Barcelona has 36 front and 11 rear; Aiguilhe is 23 front and 17 rear. Taking averages, maybe 28 front and 14 rear.\n\nAnti-roll bars: Barcelona uses 4 and 2; Aiguilhe uses 7 and 5. Maybe go to 5 for front and 3 for rear.\n\nRide height: Barcelona has 23 front and 56 rear; Aiguilhe is 25 front and 55 rear. Let's average slightly higher ride height, maybe 24 front and 55 rear.\n\nBrake pressure: Both are around 100, so keep that consistent.\n\nFront brake bias should be similar to Aiguilhe's 54%, but perhaps a bit lower for stability. Maybe 53%.\n\nEngine braking is important for quick stops; since Aiguilhe uses 30, Monza can have 25.\n\nTyre pressures: Front left and right in Aiguilhe are 23.4 each, so keep that as 23.4 front with rear at 21.0.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll adjust each parameter based on the above reasoning, ensuring values fit within valid ranges and make sense for Monza's characteristics.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 39  \nRear Wing: 32  \nDifferential On Throttle: 45  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 60  \nFront Camber: -3.35  \nRear Camber: -2.0  \nFront Toe: 0.1  \nRear Toe: 0.05  \nFront Suspension: 28  \nRear Suspension: 14  \nFront Anti-Roll Bar: 5  \nRear Anti-Roll Bar: 3  \nFront Ride Height: 24  \nRear Ride Height: 55  \nBrake Pressure: 100  \nFront Brake Bias: 53  \nEngine Braking: 25  \nRear Left Tyre Pressure: 23.4  \nRar Right Tyre Pressure: 23.4  \nFront Left Tyre Pressure: 23.4  \nFront Right Tyre Pressure: 23.4"

The user mentioned that Monza is more similar to Barein, so I should take that into account.\n\nFirst, let me look at the parameters they provided:\n\n- **Front Wing**: 45 (Monaco has 50, Barcelona 34, Barein not specified)\nSince Monza is similar to Barein, maybe keep it around 35? But wait, in the example for Barein, the front wing was 34. Maybe I can adjust slightly.\n\n- **Rear Wing**: 31 (Monaco has 45, Barcelona 30). Since Monza might have a similar setup to Barein, perhaps keep it around 25? But need to consider aerodynamics for curves. Maybe lower than Monaco but higher than Barcelona.\n\nNext, differential settings:\n- **Differential On Throttle**: 25 (Monaco has 15, Barein 40). Since Monza is similar to Barein, maybe set it closer to their 40? But wait, in the example for Barein, it's higher than Monaco. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, in the example given earlier, the user provided a sample output which had Front Differential On Throttle:25 and Off Throttle:20. Maybe Monza should follow similar but adjusted based on being more like Barein.\n\nCamber:\n- **Front Camber**: -3.5 (Monaco), -3.4 (Barcelona). Since Monza is similar to Barein, which had -3.2 for front camber, maybe set it around there.\n\nToe settings:\n- **Front Toe**: 0.0 in all examples except Monaco where Rear Toe was slightly negative. Maybe keep Front Toe at 0.0 as others did.\n\nSuspension:\n- **Front Suspension**: 4 (Monaco), 36 (Barcelona). Since Monza is similar to Barein, which had 23, maybe set it around there but perhaps a bit softer for better handling in curves.\n\nAnti-Roll Bars:\n- **Front Anti-Roll Bar**: 8 (Monaco), 4 (Barcelona). Maybe take an average or go with 5 based on being more similar to Barein's 7 and 4?\n\nRide Height:\n- **Front Ride Height**: 23 (Monaco), 36 (Barcelona). Since Monza is similar to Barein, which had 25, maybe set it around there.\n\nBrake Pressure:\n- **Brake Pressure**: 100 in Monaco and Barcelona. Barein has 97, so keep it at 100 as a base but perhaps slightly lower for safety?\n\nEngine Braking:\n- In the examples, Engine Braking was 20 (Monaco), 30 (Barcelona). Since Monza is similar to Barein with 20, maybe set it around there.\n\nBrake Bias:\n- **Front Brake Bias**: 51 in Barcelona, 54 in Barein. Maybe average or go closer to Barein's 54? Or perhaps take a middle value like 53?\n\nTyre Pressures:\n- Front: 24 (Monaco), 23.9 (Barcelona). Rear: 26.5 (Monaco), 21 (Barein). So maybe set front at around 24 and rear slightly lower, say 21.\n\nWait, but the user said Monza is more similar to Barein, so perhaps take values closer to Barein's setup while considering aerodynamics and handling.\n\nI think I need to adjust each parameter based on similarity to Barein but also considering Monza's characteristics. Let me go step by step:\n\nFront Wing: Maybe 34 (Barein) since that's similar to their front wing.\nRear Wing: Perhaps lower than Monaco, maybe around 25.\n\nDifferential On Throttle: Since in the example it was 25 and 40 for different circuits, but Monza is similar to Barein with 40, so set it higher like 35.\n\nDifferential Off Throttle: In examples, it's 20 (Barcelona), 50 (Barein). Maybe take an average or 25?\n\nWait, the user mentioned that Monza is more similar to Barein. So perhaps take differential settings closer to Barein's:\n\nFront Differential On Throttle:40\nDifferential Off Throttle:50\n\nCamber:\nFront Camber: -3.2 (Barein)\nRear Camber: Maybe similar, say -1.8.\n\nToe:\nFront Toe: 0.0 as others did.\nRear Toe: Slightly negative?

The user mentioned that Monza is more similar to Bailin, so I'll use that as a reference point.\n\nFirst, looking at the wings: In Barcelona, front wing is 45, rear is 31. Since Monza has a longer track than Barcelona but shorter than Bailin, maybe the wings can be slightly lower. Maybe reduce both by around 2-5 points each. Let's say front wing 40 and rear 36.\n\nNext, differential settings: In Barcelona, front is 25, rear 20. Since Monza has a lot of corners but also some straights, maybe increase the on-throttle differential to improve traction during acceleration in those sections. Let me go with front 30 and rear 25.\n\nCamber: Both Barcelona and Bailin have negative camber. To reduce drag without sacrificing downforce too much, I can set both fronts at -4.0 and rear at -3.0. That's a bit more aggressive than Barcelona but not as much as Bailin.\n\nToe settings: In Barcelona, both are 0.0, which is neutral. Since Monza might require some toe-in for stability in fast corners, maybe increase rear toe to 0.2 while keeping front at 0.0 or slightly negative if needed. Let's set front 0.0 and rear 0.3.\n\nSuspension: The anti-roll bars are Bailin has 7 and 5. For Monza, which is more rigid but needs better handling in turns, maybe increase both to 10 each for stiffer response. Suspension settings can be front 28 and rear 16.\n\nRide height: In Bailin, front is 25 and rear 55. Since Monza has a longer wheelbase, maybe decrease front to 20 and rear slightly higher at 57 to maintain some downforce but improve stability in the straights.\n\nBrake pressure: In Bailin, front is 97, which is on the lower side. To balance braking effort without overheating too much, I'll keep it around there, maybe 96 for front and rear at 95 each to be consistent.\n\nFront brake bias should stay similar but slightly increase if needed. Since Monza has tight corners, maybe a bit higher to ensure better stopping power during corner entry. So 57 front and 60 rear.\n\nEngine braking: In Bailin, it's 30, which is good for wet conditions. For Monza, since it might have more curves but also straights, set engine braking at 25 to balance between dry and wet performance.\n\nFinally, check all parameters against the valid ranges to ensure they're within acceptable limits.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 40  \nRear Wing: 36  \nDifferential On Throttle: 30  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 25  \nFront Camber: -4.0  \nRear Camber: -3.0  \nFront Toe: 0.0  \nRear Toe: 0.3  \nFront Suspension: 28  \nRear Suspension: 16  \nFront Anti-Roll Bar: 10  \nRear Anti-Roll Bar: 10  \nFront Ride Height: 20  \nRear Ride Height: 57  \nBrake Pressure: 96  \nFront Brake Bias: 57  \nEngine Braking: 25"

Both Barcelona and Barein have moderate wing settings, so maybe 35-40 would be good for Monza as it's a balanced value.\n\nNext, the differential on throttle. Since Monza is similar to Barein, which uses higher values, setting this at 60 seems appropriate.\n\nFor camber, I'll go with -2.8 since it's between Barcelona and Barein's settings, providing good lateral grip without too much wear.\n\nToe settings can stay at 0.0 for both front and rear as that's neutral and common in similar circuits.\n\nSuspension values should be adjusted based on Monza's characteristics. Higher ride height might help with aerodynamics but could affect stability. So I'll set front at 35 and rear at 60, similar to Barcelona but higher than Barein's 25 for better downforce.\n\nAnti-roll bars need to balance traction. Higher values increase roll stiffness. Maybe 15 for both since Monza is more like Barein.\n\nBrake pressure should be adjusted for better wet performance. Lowering it slightly from 97 to 95 might help with hydrodynamic stability.\n\nFront brake bias can stay at 60 as in Barein, which seems effective without too much restriction.\n\nEngine braking is important since curves are rapid.

Since Monza is more similar to Baréin, I'll base my settings accordingly but adjust them according to Monza's characteristics.\n\nFirst, looking at Barcelona: they have higher front wing (45) than rear (31). For Monaco, the front wing is 50 compared to Barcelona's 34 and Baréin's 34. So maybe Monza can have a slightly higher front wing but similar or lower rear wing.\n\nDifferential settings are tricky. Barcelona has low differentials on and off, while Monaco has high. Since Monza might be faster in corners, perhaps an on-throttle differential of around 25 to allow more traction without too much restriction.\n\nCamber: Both Barcelona and Monaco have negative camber for both front and rear. I'll set a slightly lower front camber (-3.0) similar to Baréin's -3.2 but maybe higher than Monaco's -3.5. Rear camber can be around -1.8 as in Baréin.\n\nToe settings: Barcelona has 0.0 for both, while Baréin uses small positive toe (0.09 and 0.08). Since Monza is similar to Baréin, maybe set front and rear toe slightly positive, like 0.05 each.\n\nSuspension: Baréin's anti-roll bar is higher on front than rear (7 vs 5), so I'll do that too. Ride height might be a bit lower on front for better aerodynamics but higher rear to improve traction in wet conditions.\n\nBrake pressure needs to balance between cooling and effectiveness. Maybe around 98, similar to Baréin's 97, with slight adjustments based on Monza's grip.\n\nFront brake bias should be moderate; maybe 54 like in Baréin for a good balance without too much front lockup.\n\nEngine braking is important for quick stops. Since Monza might have faster cornering, set it to 20 or slightly higher than Barcelona's 20 but lower than Monaco's 0. Wait, Monaco has engine braking at 0, which is different. So maybe set it to a moderate value like 15 to help with straight-line stops without affecting corner grip too much.\n\nSuspension values: Front suspension around 36 (lower than Baréin's 23? No, wait, higher is better for response. Maybe similar or a bit lower based on Monza's needs). Rear suspension can be slightly stiffer at 10 instead of Baréin's 17.\n\nWait, in the example from the user, Barcelona has front suspension as 36 and Baréin as 23. Since Monza is more like Baréin, maybe lower front suspension for less response but better stability. Rear suspension can be a bit stiffer at 10.\n\nAnti-roll bars: Front around 8 (like Monaco) and rear slightly higher at 7 or so.\n\nRide height: Front lower than Baréin's 25, maybe 20 to improve aerodynamics without sacrificing too much front grip. Rear ride height can be a bit higher, like 60 instead of 55 for better wet traction.\n\nBrake pressure is crucial; since the circuit might have wet conditions, set it slightly lower than Baréin's 97, maybe around 95 to balance cooling and effectiveness.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFront Wing: 42 (higher than Barcelona but similar to Monaco)\nRear Wing: 30 (slightly less than both, as per example)\n\nDifferential On Throttle: 25\nDifferential Off Throttle: 20\n\nFront Camber: -3.0\nRear Camber: -1.8\n\nFront Toe: 0.05\nRear Toe: 0.06 (slightly positive for better stability)\n\nSuspension:\nFront: 34 (moderate response)\nRear: 10 (stiffer rear for better grip in turns)\n\nAnti-Roll Bar Front: 7\nAnti-Roll Bar Rear: 5\n\nFront Ride Height: 20\nRear Ride Height: 60\n\nBrake Pressure: 95\n\nFront Brake Bias: 54 (moderate to keep some front grip while allowing rear lockup)\n\nEngine Braking: 15 (to help with stops without overloading the brakes)\n\nTyre Pressures:\nFront Left and Right: 23.8\nRear Left and Right: 20.9\n\nI need to check if all values are within valid ranges. Wings at 42 and 30 are okay, differentials make sense, camber seems fine, toe is acceptable, suspension settings seem reasonable, anti-roll bars within limits, ride heights look good for aerodynamics and wet grip, brake pressure around 95 is valid, front bias 54 is within the range, engine braking at 15 is okay.\n\nI think that's a solid set of regulations balancing performance in corners with straight-line stability.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 42  \nRear Wing: 30  \nDifferential On Throttle: 25  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 20  \nFront Camber: -3.0  \nRear Camber: -1.8  \nFront Toe: 0.05  \nRear Toe: 0.06  \nSuspension: 34  \nAnti-Roll Bar Front: 7  \nAnti-Roll Bar Rear: 5  \nFront Ride Height: 20  \nRear Ride Height: 60  \nBrake Pressure: 95  \nFront Brake Bias: 54  \nEngine Braking: 15  \nFront Left Tyre Pressure: 23.8  \nFront Right Tyre Pressure: 23.8  \nRear Left Tyre Pressure: 20.9  \nRear Right Tyre Pressure: 20.9"

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a set of regulations for the Monza circuit based on Julien Schein's input and previous examples from Barcelona, Aeronaut, and Monaco circuits. The goal is to generate parameters that balance performance with stability while considering factors like aerodynamics, tire wear, suspension setup, braking systems, etc.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze each parameter step by step:\n\n1. **Front Wing**: Monza has a similar track to Aeronaut from the previous examples. Looking at Barcelona (45) and Monaco (50), but since Monza is more like Aeronaut, which had 34 for Barcelona, maybe around there? But wait, in the given example, Barcelona's front wing was 45, but since Monza is similar to Aeronaut, perhaps I should take a lower value. Let me check: Aeronaut's front wing was 34, so maybe 38 would be a good balance.\n\n2. **Rear Wing**: The rear wings vary more. Barcelona had 31, Monaco 45, and Aeronaut probably similar to Monaco? Wait, in the given example for Aeronaut, it wasn't provided, but since Monza is similar to Aeronaut, maybe a lower value than Monaco's 45. Let me consider 28.\n\n3. **Differential On Throttle**: Monza is a fast circuit with frequent overtaking and quick stops. The previous examples have different values: Barcelona had 25, Monaco 15, and Aeronaut might be similar to Barcelona or Monaco. Since Monza needs more differential when accelerating for better traction but not too much to avoid oversteer, maybe around 30.\n\n4. **Differential Off Throttle**: This should be lower than On Throttle. Barcelona had 20, Monaco 20, so perhaps 15 here.\n\n5. **Front Camber**: More negative camber improves grip in corners but wears the tires faster. Since Monza is fast and has quick stops, maybe a slightly more aggressive setting. Previous examples: Barcelona -3.5, Monaco -3.5, Aeronaut might be similar. Let's go with -4.0.\n\n6. **Rear Camber**: More camber in rear for stability? Or less to save wear? Since Monza is fast, maybe a bit more negative but not too much. Previous examples: Barcelona had -2.2, Monaco -2.2, so perhaps -1.8 here.\n\n7. **Front Toe**: Positive toe (toe-in) improves straight-line stability and turning at high speeds. Previous examples show 0 for both front and rear in some circuits, but since Monza is fast, maybe a slight positive value like 0.05.\n\n8. **Rear Toe**: Negative or minimal? Since Monza might need more rear grip, perhaps a slight negative toe to improve stability during braking. Maybe -0.05.\n\n9. **Front Suspension**: Higher suspension lowers the ride height and improves aerodynamics but reduces traction. Previous examples: Barcelona 36, Monaco 41. Since Monza is fast, maybe around 38.\n\n10. **Rear Suspension**: Lower for better weight distribution on front. Previous examples had 11 (Barcelona) and 5 (Monkoo). Maybe 7 or 8 here.\n\n11. **Front Anti-Roll Bar**: Higher values reduce roll stiffness. Barcelona used 4, Monaco 8. For Monza, maybe 6 to balance between ride height and anti-roll.\n\n12. **Rear Anti-Roll Bar**: Lower than front for better weight transfer. Previous examples: Barcelona had 2, Monaco 7. Maybe 3 here.\n\n13. **Front Ride Height**: Lower values increase aerodynamics but might reduce traction in wet conditions. Previous examples: Barcelona 23, Monaco 20. For Monza, maybe 21 to be similar to Aeronaut.\n\n14. **Rear Ride Height**: Higher for better downforce and stability on damp tracks. Previous examples: Barcelona 56, Monaco 55. Maybe 57 here.\n\n15. **Brake Pressure**: Lower pressure reduces heat but might require higher in wet conditions. Previous examples: Barcelona 100, Monaco 100. Maybe 97 for Monza to be similar to Aeronaut.\n\n16. **Front Brake Bias**: Higher bias improves rear grip during braking. Previous examples: Barcelona had 51, Monaco 54. Maybe 53 here.\n\n17. **Engine Braking**: More engine braking reduces tire wear but can cause lockup. Previous examples: Barcelona 20, Monaco 30. For Monza, maybe 25 to balance both effects.\n\n8. **Tyre Pressures**: Front should be higher for better grip, rear slightly lower but still high. Previous examples: Barcelona front 23.9, rear 23.9; Monaco front 24.0, rear 24.0. So maybe front 23.5 and rear 23.5.\n\nI need to ensure all values are within the valid ranges provided earlier. Let me double-check each parameter:\n\n- Front Wing: 38 is between 1–50.\n- Rear Wing: 28 is okay.\n- Differential On Throttle: 30 is within 10–100.\n- Differential Off Throttle: 15, same range.\n- Front Camber: -4.0 is valid (-3.5 to -2.5).\n- Rear Camber: -1.8 is okay (Monkoo's was -1.8).\n- Front Toe: 0.05 is within 0.00–0.50.\n- Rear Toe: -0.05, which should be allowed as it can be negative in steps of 0.05.\n- Front Suspension: 38 is okay (1–41).\n- Rear Suspension: 7 or 8; let's pick 7 for now.\n- Front Anti-Roll Bar: 6 is within 1–21.\n- Rear Anti-Roll Bar: 3, same range.\n- Front Ride Height: 21, which is okay (Monkoo had 20).\n- Rear Ride Height: 57, but previous examples only went up to 56. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe adjust to 56 for consistency or accept the higher value as it might be necessary.\n- Brake Pressure: 97 is valid (80–100).\n- Front Brake Bias: 53 is okay (50–70).\n- Engine Braking: 25, which fits (0–100).\n\nWait, Rear Ride Height was set to 57, but the valid range for Rear Ride Height is 40–100. So maybe that's acceptable.\n\nNow, compiling all these into the required format with proper rounding and formatting.\n</think>\n\n**Reglaje Base para el circuito de Monza**\n\n- **Front Wing**: 38  \n- **Rear Wing**: 28  \n- **Differential On Throttle**: 30  \n- **Differential Off Throttle**: 15  \n- **Front Camber**: -4.0  \n- **Rear Camber**: -1.8  \n- **Front Toe**: 0.05  \n- **Rear Toe**: -0.05  \n- **Front Suspension**: 38  \n- **Rear Suspension**: 7  \n- **Front Anti-Roll Bar**: 6  \n- **Rear Anti-Roll Bar**: 3  \n- **Front Ride Height**: 21  \n- **Rear Ride Height**: 57  \n- **Brake Pressure**: 97  \n- **Front Brake Bias**: 53  \n- **Engine Braking**: 25"

    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to generate a set of regulations for the Monza circuit based on the provided information and examples from Barcelona, Barenin, and Monaco circuits. The user is an F1 engineer, so precision is key.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each parameter does. Increasing aerodynamic load (aerodinámica) improves grip in curves but slows down straightaways. A more open differential on throttle enhances traction when accelerating but can cause understeer if too open. Engine braking helps with cornering grip. Negative camber increases lateral grip but wears the tires faster. Toe-out improves handling in turns, while toe-in enhances stability at higher speeds. Soft suspension is better wet but stiffer dry. Rigid anti-roll bars increase responsiveness but reduce traction. Lower ride height improves aerodynamics and better water drainage, though it can be riskier on dry tracks. Higher brake pressure boosts braking efficiency but increases the risk of lockup. Front bias helps with straight-line braking, rear bias aids in cornering.\n\nMonza is similar to Barenin based on the user's note, so I'll focus on Barenin's settings as a starting point. However, since Monza might have specific characteristics due to its track layout, some parameters may need adjustment.\n\nLooking at Barcelona: higher camber (-3.5), softer suspension (36 and 11), lower ride height front (23) rear (56). Barenin has less camber (-3.2) but a stiffer front suspension (23) and similar ride height (25/55). Monaco has more camber, higher anti-roll bars, stiffer front suspension, etc.\n\nMonza is likely to have high aerodynamics for grip in curves, so maybe increase the front wing to 40 or higher. The rear wing might stay moderate at around 35. Camber could be a bit negative but not too aggressive, perhaps -2.8. Toe-out on front would help agility, maybe 0.10. Rear toe can remain neutral or slightly positive for stability.\n\nSuspension: since Barenin has softer front (36) and very hard rear (11), Monza might need a balance. Maybe softer front (35-40) and softer rear as well but not too hard, perhaps 20. Anti-roll bars could be moderate to stiffen the chassis without oversteer: maybe front 8-10, rear 6-7.\n\nRide height should be lower for better aerodynamics, so front at 25, rear around 60. Brake pressure needs to be sufficient but not too high to avoid lockup; perhaps 95 or similar.\n\nBrake bias on front can help with straight braking: maybe 53 as in Barenin. Engine braking is crucial for quick stops, so higher value like 25 instead of 20.\n\nTire pressures should follow the valid ranges. Front left and right could be a bit higher than rear to compensate for softer front suspension but similar to Barenin's 23-24.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll adjust each parameter step by step, ensuring they align with Monza's characteristics while considering the balance between grip, stability, and performance. I'll make sure to use valid values and apply the correct rounding as per F1 regulations.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 40  \nRear Wing: 35  \nDifferential On Throttle: 28  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 30  \nFront Camber: -2.8  \nRear Camber: -2.0  \nFront Toe: 0.10  \nRear Toe: 0.08  \nFront Suspension: 35  \nRear Suspension: 20  \nFront Anti-Roll Bar: 9  \nRear Anti-Roll Bar: 7  \nFront Ride Height: 25  \nRear Ride Height: 60  \nBrake Pressure: 95  \nFront Brake Bias: 53  \nEngine Braking: 25  \nRear Left Tyre Pressure: 24.0  \nRar Right Tyre Pressure: 24.0  \nFront Left Tyre Pressure: 23.8  \nFront Right Tyre Pressure: 23.8"

Since Monza is similar to Biarritz, I'll use their data as a starting point but adjust it according to the user's guidelines.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the aerodynamic settings. Biarritz has higher front wing (45) than Barcelona (34), so for Monza, I might increase it further, maybe around 47 or 50. The rear wing can stay similar but perhaps a bit lower since Monza is more aggressive.\n\nNext, the differential settings. Biarritz uses On Throttle at 40 and Off Throttle at 50. For Monza, which prefers a smoother ride on throttle, I'll set them slightly lower: On Throttle 35 and Off Throttle 25. This should offer more tractive effort while maintaining stability.\n\nFor camber, Biarritz has -3.2 front and -1.8 rear. Since Monza is aggressive in curves, I'll keep the same but maybe increase it slightly to enhance grip without overloading the tires. So, Front Camber: -3.45 and Rear Camber: -1.70.\n\nToe settings are similar across all circuits, so I'll stick with 0.09 front and 0.08 rear, just as in Biarritz.\n\nSuspension is where Monza might differ more. Biarritz has a very stiff setup (41 front, 5 rear). For Monza, which prefers a softer ride on wet surfaces, I'll lower the suspension to around 32 front and 6 rear. This should balance stability with water resistance.\n\nAnti-roll bars are stiffer in Biarritz (8 front,7 rear), so for Monza, I'll increase them slightly: Front Anti-Roll Bar: 9 and Rear Anti-Roll Bar: 8.\n\nRide height is crucial for traction on wet surfaces. Biarritz has 25 front and 55 rear; Monza might benefit from a slightly lower ride to improve grip without sacrificing aerodynamics too much. So, I'll set it at 24 front and 56 rear.\n\nBrake pressure in Biarritz is 97 front. For Monza, increasing it to around 100 will provide better control on wet surfaces but needs to be checked for tire wear.\n\nFront brake bias can stay similar, maybe a bit higher to ensure more braking force on the front for stability: 65.\n\nEngine braking in Biarritz is at 30. For Monza, which prefers less engine braking due to potential understeer, I'll set it lower, perhaps at 20.\n\nFinally, tire pressures should follow the valid ranges. Front left and right are around 24.0 psi each, rear slightly lower at 21.0 psi.\n\nPutting it all together, I ensure each parameter is within its valid range and reflects Monza's need for aggressive handling on wet tracks with a balance of stability and responsiveness.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 47  \nRear Wing: 38  \nDifferential On Throttle: 35  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 25  \nFront Camber: -3.45  \nRear Camber: -1.70  \nFront Toe: 0.09  \nRear Toe: 0.08  \nFront Suspension: 32  \nRear Suspension: 6  \nFront Anti-Roll Bar: 9  \nRear Anti-Roll Bar: 8  \nFront Ride Height: 24  \nRear Ride Height: 56  \nBrake Pressure: 100  \nFront Brake Bias: 65  \nEngine Braking: 20  \nRear Left Tyre Pressure: 24.0  \nRar Right Tyre Pressure: 24.0  \nFront Left Tyre Pressure: 24.0  \nFront Right Tyre Pressure: 24.0"

Since Monza is more similar to Biarritz, I'll base my settings accordingly.\n\nFirst, looking at the wings: Biarritz has 34 front and 30 rear wing. For Monza, which is a shorter track with more corners, maybe increasing both slightly would help. So, I'll set Front Wing to 42 and Rear Wing to 45.\n\nNext, differentials. Biarritz uses On Throttle at 40 and Off Throttle at 50. Monza might need a bit higher differential On Throttle for better traction during cornering but lower Off Throttle to save energy. So, I'll go with On Throttle: 38 and Off Throttle: 27.\n\nCamber is important for grip in corners. Biarritz has -3.2 front and -1.8 rear. Monza probably needs a bit more camber for faster turns but not too much to lose traction. I'll set Front Camber to -3.65 and Rear Camber to -2.0.\n\nToe settings: Biarritz uses 0.09 front and 0.08 rear. Monza might need slight toe-in in the front and rear for stability, so Toe Front: 0.14 and Toe Rear: 0.13.\n\nSuspension is crucial. Biarritz has 23 front and 17 rear. Monza's track requires softer suspension to handle bumps but stiffer for better cornering. I'll adjust to Front Suspension: 35 and Rear Suspension: 18.\n\nAnti-Roll Bars should be higher for more stability. Using Biarritz's values, Front Anti-Roll Bar: 9 and Rear Anti-Roll Bar: 6 seems appropriate.\n\nRide Height is key for aerodynamics and traction. Since Monza has a shorter track, lower ride height might help with downforce but still need some for grip in wet conditions. I'll set Front Ride Height to 20 and Rear Ride Height to 58.\n\nBrake Pressure needs to be consistent across all wheels. Biarritz uses 97 front and rear left at 21.0, front right at 23.4. For Monza, keeping it around 96 for front and rear, with 20.5 on the rear wheels makes sense.\n\nBrake Bias should favor rear braking to help with cornering but not too much since Monza has quick corners. So Front Brake Bias: 58 and Engine Braking: 15 (though engine braking is less effective here).\n\nFinally, Tyre Pressures: Front left and right at 24.0 and Rear at 21.0 are suitable as they provide enough grip without being too high.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll adjust each parameter based on the above reasoning to create a balanced reglaje for Monza.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 42  \nRear Wing: 45  \nDifferential On Throttle: 38  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 27  \nFront Camber: -3.65  \nRear Camber: -2.0  \nFront Toe: 0.14  \nRear Toe: 0.13  \nFront Suspension: 35  \nRear Suspension: 18  \nFront Anti-Roll Bar: 9  \nRear Anti-Roll Bar: 6  \nFront Ride Height: 20  \nRear Ride Height: 58  \nBrake Pressure: 96  \nFront Brake Bias: 58  \nEngine Braking: 15  \nRear Left Tyre Pressure: 20.5  \nRar Right Tyre Pressure: 20.5  \nFront Left Tyre Pressure: 24.0  \nFront Right Tyre Pressure: 24.0"

Since Monza is similar to Avarin, I'll use that as a reference.\n\nFirst, looking at the wings: Avarin has front wing 34 and rear 30. Monza might have slightly lower values because it's more aggressive in curves, so maybe front 35 and rear 32.\n\nDifferential settings are tricky. On Throttle is higher for Avarin (50) but since Monza prefers a softer differential when accelerating, I'll reduce it to 40 on throttle and 25 off, similar to Mónaco but slightly lower.\n\nCamber: Avarin uses -3.2 front and -1.8 rear. Monza needs more camber for better lateral grip, so maybe increase both a bit: -3.0 front and -2.5 rear.\n\nToe: Avarin has 0.09 front and 0.08 rear. Since toe-out is preferred in front for agility, I'll keep similar values but slightly adjust to 0.10 front and 0.07 rear.\n\nSuspension settings should be stiffer since Monza is similar to Avarin, which has stiff suspension. Front suspension can be around 35 and rear maybe 28.\n\nAnti-Roll Bars: Higher values increase stability.

The user mentioned that Monza is more similar to Bailar because it's in a similar geographical location and track type.\n\nFirst, let me go through each parameter step by step.\n\nStarting with Front Wing: In the previous examples, Barcelona had 45, Bailar had 34, and Monaco had 50. Since Monza is similar to Bailar, I'll take inspiration from Bailar's front wing setting of 34 but maybe adjust it slightly. Maybe keep it around 32 or 34.\n\nRear Wing: Barcelona was 31, Bailar 30, Monaco 45. For similarity with Bailar, perhaps set it to 30-35. Let's choose 30 for consistency.\n\nDifferential On Throttle: In previous examples, Barcelona had 25, Bailar 40, Monaco 15. Monza is closer to Bailar, so maybe increase the differential here. Maybe go up to 60 or 55. Let me set it at 60.\n\nDifferential Off Throttle: Barcelona was 20, Bailar 50, Monaco 20. Since we're following Bailar's pattern, perhaps keep it around 45-50. Let's choose 45.\n\nFront Camber: Barcelona had -3.5, Bailar -3.2, Monaco -3.5. Monza is similar to Bailar, so maybe set it slightly lower than Bailar's front camber of -3.2. Maybe go with -3.40.\n\nRear Camber: Barcelona was -2.2, Bailar -1.8, Monaco -2.2. To match Bailar, perhaps set it to -1.75.\n\nFront Toe: All previous circuits had 0.0 except Monaco which had slight variations but all were near 0. So for Monza, keep Front Toe at 0.0 and Rear Toe slightly negative? Wait, the instruction says Rear Toe is similar to other circuits but since it's more like Bailar, maybe set Rear Toe to 0.05.\n\nSuspension: In Barcelona, it was 36; Bailar had 23; Monaco 41. Since Monza is closer to Bailar, I'll take a lower value, perhaps around 28 or 30. Let's go with 30.\n\nAnti-Roll Bar: Barcelona was 4, Bailar 7, Monaco 8. For consistency with Bailar, maybe set it at 8.\n\nFront Ride Height: Barcelona had 23; Bailar 25; Monaco 20. Since Monza is similar to Bailar, let's take a value around 26-27. Maybe 26 for front and rear? Wait, Monaco had Rear Ride Height higher than front (55 vs 20), but in Bailar, they were both 36. Hmm. So maybe set Rear Ride Height slightly lower to match more closely. Let's have Front at 26 and Rear at something similar or a bit lower. Maybe 28.\n\nRear Ride Height: In previous examples, it was higher for Monza than others, so I'll keep Rear at around 50 but adjust based on desired grip. Wait, maybe take from Bailar's Rear Ride Height of 36 and perhaps set to 40 or slightly lower. Let me go with 28.\n\nBrake Pressure: Barcelona had 100; Bailar 97; Monaco 100. For Monza, similar to Bailar, maybe keep it around 95-100. Let's choose 95 for a bit more cooling.\n\nFront Brake Bias: Barcelona was 51; Bailar 54; Monaco 50. Maybe go with 53 or 54 for Monza.\n\nEngine Braking: Barcelona had 20, Bailar 30, Monaco 0. Since Monza is similar to Bailar, set it around 25-30. Let's choose 25.\n\nTyre Pressures: Front in previous examples were mostly around 24 for Monaco and higher elsewhere. For Monza, maybe follow a middle range. Set Front at 24.0 and Rear slightly lower or similar. Maybe 21.0 as in Bailar.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that Monza is more like Bailar, so perhaps the tyre pressures should be closer to Bailar's Rear Pressures of 21.0 for both front and rear? Let me set Front at 24.0 and Rear at 21.0 as in Bailar.\n\nFront Toe: Since all previous circuits had 0.0 except Monaco, maybe keep it at 0.0 for Monza's front. For Rear Toe, similar to other circuits but perhaps slightly more negative for better grip on curves? Let me set Rear Toe to -0.05 or something close.\n\nWait, the user instruction says that toe-out is better in front for agility and toe-in in rear for stability. So maybe keep Rear Toe at 0.05 (slightly positive) or a bit negative. But since the examples from Bailar had Rear Toe slightly positive (0.08), perhaps set it to -0.05.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll adjust each parameter based on Monza's similarity to Bailar, considering the user's instructions and the need for valid ranges.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 32  \nRear Wing: 30  \nDifferential On Throttle: 60  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 45  \nFront Camber: -3.40  \nRear Camber: -1.75  \nFront Toe: 0.00  \nRear Toe: -0.05  \nSuspension: 30  \nAnti-Roll Bar: 8  \nFront Ride Height: 26  \nRear Ride Height: 28  \nBrake Pressure: 95  \nFront Brake Bias: 54  \nEngine Braking: 25  \nRear Left Tyre Pressure: 21.0  \nRear Right Tyre Pressure: 21.0  \nFront Left Tyre Pressure: 24.0  \nFront Right Tyre Pressure: 24.0"

Since Monza is more similar to Barein, I'll use that as a starting point but adjust some parameters considering Monza's characteristics.\n\nFirst, looking at the wings: Barcelona has 45 front and 31 rear, while Barein has 34 and 30 respectively. Since Monza might have a slightly different setup, maybe around 36 for front and 28 for rear to balance performance without being too extreme.\n\nThe differential settings in Barein are On Throttle:40 and Off Throttle:50. For Monza, I'll consider higher values to allow more flexibility during cornering but not too high to cause issues on straights. Maybe 35 and 25.\n\nCamber is important for grip. Barein uses -3.2 front and -1.8 rear. To improve lateral grip without overloading the tires, I'll set Monza's camber slightly higher: maybe -3.0 front and -1.6 rear.\n\nToe settings in Barein are 0.09 front and 0.08 rear. Since Monza is a shorter track with more corners, tighter toe might be beneficial. Perhaps decrease them to 0.07 front and 0.06 rear.\n\nSuspension stiffness: Higher values reduce roll. Monza's track width isn't specified, but I'll keep the suspension similar to Barein, maybe 25 front and 18 rear.\n\nAnti-roll bars are crucial for stability. Higher values in front provide more roll control. Using 7 front and 5 rear should work well.\n\nRide height: Rear is higher in Monza than Front, so keeping rear at 55 and front around 23 or slightly lower like 22 makes sense.\n\nBrake pressure needs to be consistent across all wheels for uniform wear. Keeping it at 98 seems reasonable as in Barein.\n\nFront brake bias should be similar since Monza is a balanced track. Using 51, same as Barein.\n\nEngine braking might need adjustment based on the circuit's tight corners. Lowering it from 30 to maybe 20 could help manage grip better during turns.\n\nFinally, tire pressures: Fronts at 24 and 26.5, Rears at 22.5 each.

Maybe I'll keep them a bit lower than those, maybe around 38 front and 28 rear.\n\nDifferential settings are tricky because higher values mean more on-throttle differential, which can help with traction in corners. Since Monza is fast but requires good grip, perhaps similar to Barein's 40 on throttle and 50 off, I'll set it at 35 on and 60 off.\n\nCamber: Both Barcelona and Barein have negative camber. In Barcelona, front is -3.5 and rear -2.2; in Barein, front is -3.2 and rear -1.8. To balance between the two, maybe go slightly lower than both. Let's say front -3.4 and rear -2.0.\n\nToe: Both circuits have 0 toe, but since Toe-out is better for agility, perhaps a slight positive toe in the front? Maybe 0.05 front and 0.08 rear, similar to Monaco's slightly positive toe.\n\nSuspension settings: Higher suspension reduces weight on wheels, which might be good for grip.

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to help generate a set of regulations for the Monaco Circuit based on the given information and examples from Barcelona and Baréin circuits. First, I'll read through all the details carefully.\n\nThe user is an F1 engineer working on Monza's setup. They provided some key principles: increasing aerodynamic downforce improves cornering grip but reduces top speed, a more open differential under acceleration enhances traction while a closed one might cause understeer, engine braking can help with quick turns, negative camber increases lateral grip at the cost of wear, toe-out improves agility in corners and toe-in aids stability, ride height affects both aerodynamics and ground clearance, stiffer anti-roll bars improve responsiveness but reduce traction, lower brake pressure reduces heating but might sacrifice some stopping power.\n\nThey also provided three previous regulations: Barcelona, Baréin, and Monaco. From the context, Monaco is similar to Baréin based on their features. So I should base Monza's setup more closely on Baréin but with adjustments considering it's a stiffer track.\n\nLooking at the parameters:\n\nFront Wing in Baréin was 34, which is lower than both Barcelona and Monaco. Since Monaco is similar to Baréin, maybe keeping it around 35 would be good, perhaps slightly higher for better downforce without overdoing it.\n\nRear Wing in Baréin was 30; same as Monaco's max rear wing could be 45? Wait no, the user said Monaco is more similar to Baréin. So maybe taking Rear Wing from Baréin at 45 but perhaps a bit higher for better grip?\n\nDifferential On Throttle: Baréin has 40 and Monaco 15. Since Monza might need more traction under acceleration, maybe set it higher than Barcelona's 25 but lower than Baréin's 40 to balance.\n\nEngine Braking was 30 in Baréin; for Monaco, which is similar but perhaps needs a bit more because of stiffer handling? Maybe around 30 as well or slightly higher?\n\nFront Camber: Both Barcelona and Baréin have negative camber. In Baréin it's -3.2. For Monza, maybe keep it at -3.5 to maintain lateral grip.\n\nRear Camber is similar in all examples, so perhaps set to -2.0 for better rear grip without excessive wear.\n\nToe settings: Both Barcelona and Baréin have 0.0, but Toe-in can help with stability. Maybe set Rear Toe to a small positive value like 0.10 as done in Baréin's Rear Toe.\n\nSuspension stiffness: Baréin has Front Suspension at 23, Rear at 17. For stiffer handling, maybe increase front suspension and decrease rear? Or keep similar but adjust based on Monza's characteristics.\n\nAnti-Roll Bars: Baréin uses 7 and 5 respectively. To enhance stability without too much weight transfer, perhaps increase both to 8 and 6.\n\nRide Height is tricky. In Baréin, Rear Ride Height was higher at 55. Since Monza might need more aerodynamics, set Rear Ride Height slightly lower but still high for ground clearance. Maybe Front:24, Rear:57 as in Baréin's example.\n\nBrake Pressure in Baréin is 97; maybe keep it around there to ensure enough stopping power without overheating too much.\n\nFront Brake Bias should be higher than rear since front tires might wear more on stiffer tracks. In Baréin, Front Bias was 54 and Rear at 10 (assumed from the example). Maybe set Front Bias to 60 for better braking efficiency.\n\nEngine Braking in Baréin is 30; adding that could help with quick turns but maybe keep it similar or slightly higher.\n\nTyre pressures: Front in Baréin was 23.4, Rear 21.0. For Monza, perhaps front a bit lower to reduce weight transfer and rear slightly higher for better grip.\n\nWait, let me check the ranges:\n\nFront Wing max is 50, so 35 seems reasonable.\nRear Wing in Baréin was 45; Monaco's Rear Wing is similar but maybe set it at 46 as per user instruction to round correctly.\n\nDifferential On Throttle: Since Baréin uses 40 and Monaco might need more traction, perhaps 35-45. I'll choose 35.\n\nEngine Braking in Baréin was 30; for stiffer handling, maybe increase to 30 as well.\n\nFront Camber at -3.5 is a bit lower than Baréin's -3.2 but increases lateral grip.\nRear Camber at -2.0 is more aggressive, which might be good for Monaco's stiffer rear end.\n\nToe settings: Rear Toe at 0.10 as in Baréin; Front Toe can stay at 0.05 to keep light steering.\n\nSuspension: Front at 41 (same as Monaco) and Rear at 5 (as per example, but maybe increase rear slightly? Wait, Baréin's Rear was 17. Maybe keep it at 18 for stiffer handling without oversteer).\n\nAnti-Roll Bars: Front 8, Rear 6.\n\nRide Height: Front 24, Rear 57 as in Baréin.\n\nBrake Pressure: 97\n\nFront Brake Bias: 60 (higher than rear's assumed 10)\n\nTyre Pressures: Front at 23.5 and Rear at 21.0.\n\nWait, but the user said to round correctly. So front camber -3.5 is already two decimals, which is fine. Toe settings are in two decimals as per instructions.\n\nSo compiling all these thoughts into a coherent set of parameters that match the Monaco circuit's characteristics.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 35  \nRear Wing: 46  \nDifferential On Throttle: 35  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 40  \nFront Camber: -3.5  \nRear Camber: -2.0  \nFront Toe: 0.05  \nRear Toe: 0.10  \nFront Suspension: 41  \nRear Suspension: 18  \nFront Anti-Roll Bar: 8  \nRear Anti-Roll Bar: 6  \nFront Ride Height: 24  \nRear Ride Height: 57  \nBrake Pressure: 97  \nFront Brake Bias: 60  \nEngine Braking: 30"

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to help generate a set of regulations for the Monza circuit based on Julien Schein's professional experience as an F1 engineer. The user provided previous examples from Barcelona and Aargues (probably meant Baréin), which are similar circuits. They mentioned that Monza is more similar to Baréin, so I should focus on taking features from Baréin but adjust them slightly for Monza.\n\nFirst, looking at the wings: Baréin has front wing 34 and rear 30. Since Monza might have a track layout closer to Monaco, which typically uses flared wings, maybe increase the rear wing slightly or keep it similar. But since the user says Monza is more like Baréin, I'll stick with their values but perhaps tweak them a bit for Monza's characteristics.\n\nDifferential settings: Baréin has differential on throttle at 40 and off at 50. For Monza, which might have a tighter layout, maybe make the differential more open when accelerating to improve traction, so I could increase both values slightly or adjust them to better suit Monza's needs.\n\nToe settings: Baréin uses front toe +0.09 and rear +0.08, meaning slight toe-out for front and rear. For Monza, which is a shorter track with sharper corners, maybe increase the toe slightly more for better grip.\n\nSuspension: Baréin has front suspension 23 and rear 17. Monza might benefit from a stiffer front setup to handle lateral forces better, so I could increase the front suspension value while keeping the rear lower.\n\nAnti-Roll Bars: Baréin uses 7 and 5 for front and rear. For Monza, maybe slightly increase both but keep them balanced since the track is more aggressive.\n\nRide height: Baréin has front 25 and rear 55, which are on the lower side to improve aerodynamics. For Monza, I might slightly adjust these values without changing much because it's similar in terms of aero focus.\n\nBrake pressure: Baréin uses 97 front and 97 rear. Monza might benefit from a bit higher brake pressure for better stopping power while ensuring it doesn't overheat too quickly.\n\nFront Brake Bias: Baréin has 54, which is moderate. For Monza, maybe increase it slightly to around 60 to improve straight-line braking without sacrificing cornering too much.\n\nEngine Braking: Baréin uses 30, which is high for F1 regulations (usually up to 25). Since Monza might have steeper corners, engine braking could be higher but capped at the maximum allowed value of 75. So setting it to 60 seems reasonable.\n\nCamber settings: Baréin has front -3.2 and rear -1.8. For Monza, maybe increase the rear camber slightly for better lateral grip without oversteering too much. Perhaps front -3.4 and rear -2.2.\n\nToe adjustments: Since Monza might require more stability, I can adjust the toe to be slightly more in the front but not too extreme.\n\nI should also consider that Monza is a shorter track with flared corners, so higher lateral grip is needed. Therefore, increasing camber a bit on the rear and adjusting suspension stiffness would make sense. Additionally, ensuring that all values stay within F1 regulations (like Engine Braking up to 75) is crucial.\n\nLet me list out the parameters:\n\nFront Wing: Similar to Baréin's 34, maybe keep it at 34 but slightly adjust for Monza's shorter length.\nRear Wing: Maybe increase from 30 to 31 to accommodate tighter turns.\nDifferential On Throttle: Increase from 40 to 50 to improve traction on curves.\nDifferential Off Throttle: From 50, maybe keep it the same or slightly lower if needed. But since Monza prefers more open diffs when accelerating, perhaps increase it a bit to 60.\nFront Camber: Baréin's -3.2 could go up to -3.4 for better lateral grip on tighter corners.\nRear Camber: From -1.8 in Baréin, maybe raise it to -2.2 but check if that's allowed (since rear camber can't be more negative than front).\nFront Toe: Maybe increase from +0.09 to +0.10 for better stability.\nRear Toe: Similarly, go up from +0.08 to +0.10.\nSuspension: Front at 25, Rear at 18 (slightly stiffer front)\nAnti-Roll Bars: Front 8, Rear 6\nFront Ride Height: Maybe keep it similar at 23 but check if rear needs adjustment; in Baréin it's 56, which is quite high. For Monza, maybe lower rear to 48.\nBrake Pressure: Increase front from 97 to perhaps 100 for better stopping without overheating too much.\nFront Brake Bias: From 54 go up to 60\nEngine Braking: Since it's more than Baréin, set it to 60 instead of 30.\n\nI need to ensure all values are within the F1 regulations. For example, Engine Braking can't exceed 75, so 60 is fine. Front Brake Bias max is 70, so 60 is acceptable.\n\nPutting it all together while rounding appropriately and ensuring no invalid numbers.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 34  \nRear Wing: 31  \nDifferential On Throttle: 50  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 60  \nFront Camber: -3.4  \nRear Camber: -2.2  \nFront Toe: +0.10  \nRear Toe: +0.10  \nFront Suspension: 25  \nRear Suspension: 18  \nFront Anti-Roll Bar: 8  \nRear Anti-Roll Bar: 6  \nFront Ride Height: 23  \nRear Ride Height: 48  \nBrake Pressure: 100  \nFront Brake Bias: 60  \nEngine Braking: 60"

The user provided previous setups from Barcelona and Austin, which are similar in terms of setup, so Monza is probably closer to Austin (Barenin). \n\nFirst, I'll look at the parameters given for each setup. For Barcelona, front wing was 45, rear 31; differential on throttle was 25, off 20. Camber front -3.5, rear -2.2. Toe was neutral, suspension front 36, rear 11. Anti-roll bars were 4 and 2. Ride height front 23, rear 56. Brake pressure 100, bias 51, engine braking 20.\n\nFor Austin (Barenin), front wing 34, rear 30; differential on throttle 40, off 50. Camber front -3.2, rear -1.8. Toe front 0.09, rear 0.08. Suspension front 23, rear 17. Anti-roll bars 7 and 5. Ride height front 25, rear 55. Brake pressure 97, bias 54, engine braking 30.\n\nMonza is similar to Austin because it's a street circuit with less corners compared to Monaco, which was more aggressive in setup. \n\nSo I'll take the Barenin setup and adjust values towards Monza's characteristics. Since Monza might have shorter front overhangs but wider rear, perhaps reducing anti-roll bars as well.\n\nSuspension: In Barenin, front is 23, rear 17; for Monza, maybe front slightly higher, rear lower to maintain some roll control. Maybe front 35, rear 10.\n\nEngine braking in Barenin was 30; Monza might benefit more from this since it's a street circuit with less banked corners, so higher engine braking could help in straights.\n\nTires: In Barenin, front left and right pressures were around 23.4, rear about 21. For Monza, perhaps slightly lower pressures to reduce weight but maintain grip, maybe front 24, rear 20.5 each side.\n\nBrake bias is similar; in Barenin it's 54. Monza might have a bit higher, like 56, to prioritize stopping power on the front.\n\nToe: In Barenin, front was 0.09 and rear 0.08. For Monza, maybe slightly less toe-in for better stability in curves without oversteering. Maybe front 0.10, rear 0.075.\n\nCamber: Barenin had -3.2 front and -1.8 rear. For Monza, perhaps similar but a bit more camber on the rear to improve straight line grip. Front -3.2, rear -2.0.\n\nDifferential on throttle in Barenin was 40; for Monza, maybe slightly higher to allow more speed at the front, so 50.\n\nFront wing might be similar but perhaps a bit higher if Monza has less downforce needs than Barcelona. Maybe 38 instead of 34.\n\nRide height: In Barenin, front was 25, rear 55. For Monza, maybe reduce both slightly, like front 23 and rear 56, similar to Barcelona but a bit lower for better ride comfort.\n\nLet me put it all together, making sure values are within valid ranges.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 38  \nRear Wing: 30  \nDifferential On Throttle: 50  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 45  \nFront Camber: -3.2  \nRear Camber: -2.0  \nFront Toe: 0.10  \nRear Toe: 0.075  \nFront Suspension: 35  \nRear Suspension: 10  \nFront Anti-Roll Bar: 9  \nRear Anti-Roll Bar: 6  \nFront Ride Height: 23  \nRear Ride Height: 56  \nBrake Pressure: 100.0  \nFront Brake Bias: 56  \nEngine Braking: 40  \nFront Left Tyre Pressure: 24.0  \nFront Right Tyre Pressure: 24.0  \nRear Left Tyre Pressure: 20.5  \nRar Right Tyre Pressure: 20.5"

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to generate a set of regulations for the Monza circuit based on the given information and examples from Barcelona and Biarritz. First, I should figure out what makes Monza similar to. The user mentioned that Monza is more similar to Biarritz, so I'll base my settings around Biarritz's parameters.\n\nLooking at Biarritz's reglaje, they have a front wing of 34, which is lower than Barcelona's 45 but higher than a typical setting. Their rear wing is 30, which seems balanced. For differential on throttle, Biarritz uses 40, and off throttle is 50. This suggests a setup that allows some flexibility in acceleration.\n\nFront camber is -3.2, which is more aggressive than Barcelona's -3.5 but not too extreme. Rear camber is -1.8, which is less aggressive than Biarritz's rear camber of -2.2. Toe settings are both 0.09 for front and 0.08 for rear, slightly positive, which might help with stability.\n\nSuspension settings in Biarritz are front suspension 23 and rear 17, which seems okay but maybe a bit stiff on the front. Anti-roll bars are 7 and 5, again suggesting some stiffness. Ride height is front 25 and rear 55, which should provide good aerodynamics without too much ground effect.\n\nBrake pressure for Biarritz is 97, which is lower than Barcelona's 100 but higher than Monaco's 100—wait, no, Monaco has 100. Hmm, maybe I need to check that again. Engine braking in Biarritz is 30, while Barcelona uses 20 and Monaco 0.\n\nFor the pressures, front left and right are 23.4 for front and 21.0 for rear, similar to Biarritz's settings but slightly higher. Rear left and right are both 21.0, which is standard.\n\nI need to make sure all values fit within F1 rules, so I'll adjust if necessary. For example, the differential on and off throttle must be in multiples of 5 between 10-100. Engine braking is also in multiples of 5 between 0-100. Tyre pressures should have one decimal place.\n\nI think I've covered all the points based on similarity to Biarritz and considering Monza's characteristics.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 34  \nRear Wing: 30  \nDifferential On Throttle: 40  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 50  \nFront Camber: -3.2  \nRear Camber: -1.8  \nFront Toe: 0.09  \nRear Toe: 0.08  \nFront Suspension: 23  \nRear Suspension: 17  \nFront Anti-Roll Bar: 7  \nRear Anti-Roll Bar: 5  \nFront Ride Height: 25  \nRear Ride Height: 55  \nBrake Pressure: 97  \nFront Brake Bias: 54  \nEngine Braking: 30  \nReaL Left Tyre Pressure: 21.0  \nReaL Right Tyre Pressure: 21.0  \nFront Left Tyre Pressure: 23.4  \nFront Right Tyre Pressure: 23.4"

    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a set of regulations for the Monza circuit based on Julien Schein's experience and the provided examples from Barcelona and Biarritz (which is also called Barein). Since Monza is similar to Barein, I'll use that as a reference.\n\nFirst, let me note the key points given:\n\n1. **Aerodynamic Load**: Increasing downforce improves cornering grip but reduces top speed at apex.\n2. **Differential Settings**: More open on throttle improves traction; more closed can cause understeer.\n3. **Engine Braking**: Can help with quick turns.\n4. **Camber**: More negative increases lateral grip but wears tires faster.\n5. **Toe**: Front toe-out for agility, rear toe-in for stability.\n6. **Suspension**: Softer ride height improves wet grip; stiffer is better on dry.\n7. **Anti-Roll Bars**: Rigid bars increase responsiveness but reduce traction.\n8. **Brake Pressure and Bias**: Higher pressure reduces wear but can cause lockup; bias affects straight-line braking.\n\nLooking at Biarritz's settings:\n\n- Front Wing: 34 (moderate)\n- Rear Wing: 30 (slightly less than front, typical for balance)\n- Differential On Throttle: 40 (more open to help traction, but may cause understeer)\n- Differential Off Throttle: 50 (closed to prevent oversteer and weight shift)\n- Front Camber: -3.2 (slightly negative for lateral grip)\n- Rear Camber: -1.8 (less negative than front, as rear is more tolerant of wear)\n- Toe: Front 0.09, Rear 0.08 (very slight toe-out to enhance cornering)\n- Suspension: Front 23, Rear 17 (softer front for wet grip; stiffer rear might be too much, but Monza has wet conditions similar to Biarritz?)\nWait, no, Monza is in Italy, which can have wet and dry conditions. But since it's more similar to Barein, perhaps the suspension should be softer? Hmm.\n\nBut looking at the settings for Monza as similar to Barein:\n\n- Front Wing: 34\n- Rear Wing: 30\n- Differential On Throttle: 40\n- Differential Off Throttle: 50\n- Front Camber: -3.2\n- Rear Camber: -1.8\n- Toe: Front 0.09, Rear 0.08 (slightly toe-out)\n- Suspension: Front 23, Rear 17 (softer front for better wet grip; stiffer rear might be okay as Rear can handle it?)\nWait, in Biarritz, Rear suspension is lower at 17, which makes sense for a track that's fast but requires some stability.\n\nBut since Monza is more like Barein, maybe the suspension should be similar to Biarritz? Or wait, no, because the user says Monza is similar to Barein. So perhaps we can take the settings from Biarritz as they are closer in nature to Barein's track and thus their regulations.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the previous examples:\n\nBarcelona: settings are more aggressive with higher wings, softer suspension (front 36), anti-roll bars front 4, rear 2. Biarritz has moderate wings but softer front suspension (23) and stiffer rear (17). Monza is a circuit known for high-speed corners, so perhaps we need a balance between traction and stability.\n\nBut given that Monza is similar to Barein, which is also a fast circuit with tight corners. So maybe the settings should be more aggressive in downforce but not too closed on throttle.\n\nSo let me try to adjust based on the previous examples:\n\nFront Wing: 34 (moderate)\nRear Wing: 30\nDifferential On Throttle: 40 (more open for traction, but may cause understeer slightly)\nDifferential Off Throttle: 50 (closed to prevent oversteer and weight shift)\n\nFront Camber: -3.2 (slightly negative for lateral grip)\nRear Camber: -1.8\nToe: Front 0.09, Rear 0.08\n\nSuspension:\nFront: 23 (softer for wet grip)\nRear: 17 (stiffer rear might help with stability in turns)\n\nAnti-Roll Bars: Front 4, Rear 2 (moderate to maintain some control without too much)\n\nRide Height: Front 25, Rear 55 (softer front for better grip on wet, stiffer rear for stability)\nBrake Pressure: 97 (moderate to reduce wear but allow effective braking)\nFront Brake Bias: 54 (similar to Biarritz, slight bias towards front for good straight-line braking and quick turns)\nEngine Braking: 30 (good for quick recovery from braking in corners)\n\nTyre Pressures:\nFront Left/Right: 24.0\nRear Left/Right: 23.9\n\nWait, but the user says Monza is more similar to Barein, which has front wing 50 and rear 45. So maybe we should adjust wings higher?\n\nBut considering Biarritz's settings are moderate with wings at 34 and 30, perhaps Monza can have slightly higher front wing for better downforce.\n\nFront Wing: 40\nRear Wing: 35\n\nDifferential On Throttle: 45 (more open)\nDifferential Off Throttle: 60 (closed)\n\nFront Camber: -3.5\nRear Camber: -2.2\n\nToe: Front 0.1, Rear 0.08 (slightly more toe-out for better cornering)\n\nSuspension:\nFront: 40 (softer)\nRear: 20 (stiffer rear might be okay as Rear can handle it on dry but softer for wet)\n\nAnti-Roll Bars: Front 6, Rear 3\n\nRide Height: Front 28, Rear 57\nBrake Pressure: 95\nFront Brake Bias: 55\nEngine Braking: 35\n\nTyre Pressures:\nFront Left/Right: 24.0\nRear Left/Right: 23.5\n\nWait, but in the previous examples, Biarritz has Rear anti-roll bar at 2 and front at 7, so maybe Monza's rear anti-roll should be lower.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps stick closer to Biarritz's settings with moderate adjustments.\n\nI think I need to balance between aggressive downforce (front wing higher) but not too closed on throttle. Also, considering Monza is similar to Barein, which has softer suspension, so front softer and rear stiffer might make sense.\n\nSo finalizing:\n\nFront Wing: 40\nRear Wing: 35\nDifferential On Throttle: 45\nDifferential Off Throttle: 60\nFront Camber: -3.5\nRear Camber: -2.2\nFront Toe: 0.10\nRear Toe: 0.08\nFront Suspension: 40\nRear Suspension: 20\nFront Anti-Roll Bar: 6\nRear Anti-Roll Bar: 3\nFront Ride Height: 28\nRear Ride Height: 57\nBrake Pressure: 95\nFront Brake Bias: 55\nEngine Braking: 35\nFront Left Tyre Pressure: 24.0\nFront Right Tyre Pressure: 24.0\nRear Left Tyre Pressure: 23.5\nRear Right Tyre Pressure: 23.5\n\nI think this makes sense as a balance between downforce, traction, and stability.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 40  \nRear Wing: 35  \nDifferential On Throttle: 45  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 60  \nFront Camber: -3.5  \nRear Camber: -2.2  \nFront Toe: 0.10  \nRear Toe: 0.08  \nFront Suspension: 40  \nRear Suspension: 20  \nFront Anti-Roll Bar: 6  \nRear Anti-Roll Bar: 3  \nFront Ride Height: 28  \nRear Ride Height: 57  \nBrake Pressure: 95  \nFront Brake Bias: 55  \nEngine Braking: 35  \nFront Left Tyre Pressure: 24.0  \nFront Right Tyre Pressure: 24.0  \nRear Left Tyre Pressure: 23.5  \nRar Right Tyre Pressure: 23.5"

Monza is similar to Barcelona or Barein, but according to the user, it's more like Barein.\n\nFirst, looking at the previous reglajes:\n\nBarcelona:\n- Front Wing: 45\n- Rear Wing: 31\n\nBarein:\n- Front Wing: 34\n- Rear Wing: 30\n\nSince Monza is similar to Barein, I'll take the Rear Wing as a base. Maybe decrease it slightly? Let's go with 28.\n\nNext, differential settings. Barein has On Throttle at 40 and Off at 50. For Monza, which might have more variable conditions, maybe lower the On Throttle to 35 and Off to 45 for better adaptability during braking.\n\nCamber: Barein uses -3.2 front and -1.8 rear. Since Monza is wetter, maybe increase camber slightly. Front: -3.0, Rear: -1.6.\n\nToe: Barein has small positive toe at 0.09 rear and 0.08 front. For Monza, perhaps make both a bit more positive for better handling in corners. Let's go with Front Toe 0.10 and Rear Toe 0.075.\n\nSuspension: In Barcelona, Front is 36, Rear 11. For Monza, maybe higher suspension to improve stability on wet. Increase front to 40 and rear to 12 for better grip in water conditions.\n\nAnti-Roll Bars: Higher anti-roll would help reduce roll in corners. So increase both front and rear. Maybe Front ARB 6, Rear ARB 3.\n\nRide Height: In Barcelona, Rear is higher at 56. Monza might have similar, but since it's wet, maybe a bit lower for better hydrodynamic stability. Let's set Rear Ride Height to 54 and Front to 20 as before.\n\nBrake Pressure: In Barein, it's 97 front and 100 rear. For Monza, perhaps increase slightly front to 100 and rear to 98 for better control during braking in wet conditions.\n\nFront Brake Bias: Higher bias can help with straight-line stability while maintaining cornering grip. Maybe go up from 54 to 60.\n\nEngine Braking: Since Monza is similar to Barein, which has engine braking at 30, maybe set it a bit higher for better energy recovery during braking in wet conditions. Let's use 25.\n\nI should check all parameters against the valid ranges:\n\n- Wing: 28 is within 1–50.\n- Differential settings are within 10–100 and saltos de 5, so 35 and 45 are okay.\n- Engine Braking at 25 is acceptable since it can go up to 100, but wait, engine braking in F1 usually doesn't exceed certain limits. Maybe adjust to a higher value like 40? Hmm, no, because the user mentioned Monza might be wetter and engine braking helps with stability.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's previous advice: \"Engine Braking puede usarse para mejorar rotación en curvas rápidas.\" So it should help with grip in tight corners. Therefore, maybe higher engine braking is better. Let me increase it to 40.\n\nBrake pressure front at 100 and rear at 98 are within the valid range of 80–100.\n\nSuspension settings seem okay: Front 40, Rear 12.\n\nAnti-Roll Bars: Front 6, Rear 3. Both within their ranges (Front ARB up to 21, Rear up to 7).\n\nRide Heights are appropriate as per the guidelines.\n\nSo compiling all these thoughts into a coherent reglaje.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 28  \nRear Wing: 28  \nDifferential On Throttle: 35  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 45  \nFront Camber: -3.0  \nRear Camber: -1.6  \nFront Toe: 0.10  \nRear Toe: 0.075  \nFront Suspension: 40  \nRear Suspension: 12  \nFront Anti-Roll Bar: 6  \nRear Anti-Roll Bar: 3  \nFront Ride Height: 20  \nRear Ride Height: 54  \nBrake Pressure: 100 (front) / 98 (rear)  \nFront Brake Bias: 60  \nEngine Braking: 40"

Bernie has lower numbers, so maybe Monza's could be slightly different but in the same range. Maybe around 37 for front and 28 for rear.\n\nDifferential settings are higher on throttle for faster acceleration. Since Bernie uses 40 and 50, I'll go a bit lower to balance agarre and speed: 35 front and 45 rear.\n\nCamber is negative for both. Barcelona has -3.5/-2.2, Bernie's is similar but maybe slightly more aggressive: let's say -3.7 front and -2.0 rear.\n\nToe is 0 in both examples, so I'll keep that consistent unless there's a reason to change it.\n\nSuspension settings: Bernie uses lower numbers for better stability. Front suspension around 25 and rear at 15 seems reasonable.\n\nAnti-roll bars should be similar; maybe 6 front and 4 rear.\n\nRide height is crucial for traction, especially in wet conditions. Bernie has 25 front and 55 rear, so Monza could be a bit lower: 23 front and 57 rear.\n\nBrake pressure needs to be sufficient but not too high to avoid skidding. Bernie uses 97, maybe Monza can go a bit higher at 100.\n\nFront brake bias is important for straight-line stopping.

The user mentioned that Monza is similar to Baréin, so I should consider the characteristics of both.\n\nFirst, looking at the wings: Barcelona has 45 front and 31 rear, while Baréin has 34 front and 30 rear. Since Monza is similar to Baréin, maybe a middle value would be appropriate. Let's take an average between the two. For front wing, (45+34)/2 = 39.5, but since it needs to be valid, I can set it at 38.\n\nNext, differential settings: Barcelona has 25 on and 20 off, Baréin has 40 on and 50 off. For Monza, maybe a higher on value because the circuit might require more traction when accelerating. So, I'll go with 60 front on and 70 rear off.\n\nFor camber: Barcelona is -3.5 and -2.2; Baréin is -3.2 and -1.8. Monza might have a slightly negative camber to reduce downforce while keeping some grip. Maybe -3.4 front and -2.1 rear, which averages between the two.\n\nToe settings: Barcelona has 0 for both, Baréin has 0.09 rear left and 0.08 rear right. Since Monza is similar to Baréin, maybe a slight positive toe for better stability in turns. Let's set it at 0.10 front and 0.05 rear.\n\nSuspension: Barcelona has 36 front and 11 rear; Baréin has 23 and 17. Monza might need a balance between them, so maybe 28 front and 14 rear.\n\nAnti-roll bars: Barcelona is 4 and 2; Baréin is 7 and 5. To balance it, I can take the average for both, resulting in 6 front and 4.5 rear.\n\nRide height: Barcelona has 23 front and 56 rear; Baréin has 25 front and 55 rear. Monza might have a slightly lower ride height to improve aerodynamics but higher rear for better traction. So maybe 22 front and 57 rear.\n\nBrake pressure: Barcelona is 100, Baréin is 97. Monza can take an average of 98.5, rounded to 98.6.\n\nFront brake bias: Barcelona has 51; Baréin has 54. For Monza, a value around 53 makes sense.\n\nEngine braking is only applied in Baréin at 20 and not mentioned for others except Monaco at 0. Since Monza might use engine braking, I'll set it to 15 as a middle value between 0 and higher values.\n\nTire pressures: Barcelona has front left-right at 23.9 and rear at 23.9; Baréin's front is 23.4 and rear not specified but from the example, maybe similar. For Monza, I'll average them to 23.5 for fronts and 21.0 for rears.\n\nI need to ensure all values are within valid ranges and apply the correct rounding as per F1 regulations.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 38  \nRear Wing: 34  \nDifferential On Throttle: 60  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 70  \nFront Camber: -3.4  \nRear Camber: -2.1  \nFront Toe: 0.10  \nRear Toe: 0.05  \nFront Suspension: 28  \nRear Suspension: 14  \nFront Anti-Roll Bar: 6  \nRear Anti-Roll Bar: 4.5  \nFront Ride Height: 22  \nRear Ride Height: 57  \nBrake Pressure: 98.6  \nFront Brake Bias: 53  \nEngine Braking: 15  \nFront Left Tyre Pressure: 23.5  \nFront Right Tyre Pressure: 23.5  \nRear Left Tyre Pressure: 21.0  \nRar Right Tyre Pressure: 21.0"

Since Monza is more similar to Aeronaut, I'll use that as a reference.\n\nFirst, the front wing was higher in Aeronaut (45), so I'll keep it at 45 but maybe increase slightly for better aerodynamics? Let's say 47.\n\nRear wing should be lower than front since Monza is more aggressive. So instead of 31, I might go down to 28.\n\nDifferential On Throttle: Aeronaut has 20, so keeping it same makes sense but maybe slightly higher for better traction? Maybe 25.\n\nDifferential Off Throttle should be lower if we're making the car harder to roll. So instead of 20, go down to 15.\n\nFront camber was -3.5 in Barcelona and Aeronaut has -3.5 as well. Keep it at -3.5 for similar front grip.\n\nRear camber could be a bit higher to improve rear grip without too much loss. Let's try -2.0 from the previous 2.2.\n\nFront Toe was 0.0 in both, so keep that but maybe increase slightly for better handling? Maybe 0.15.\n\nRear Toe should also be increased, perhaps to 0.30 for better stability on corner entry.\n\nSuspension is lower than usual for traction, so reduce from 42 to maybe 38.\n\nAnti-Roll Bars: Higher values give more roll resistance. From 9 in Aeronaut, increase to 15.\n\nRide height front at 26 and rear at 57 seems reasonable but slightly higher rear might help with traction on dry conditions.\n\nBrake pressure should be consistent with Aeronaut's 100 bar front and a bit lower rear at 98.5 for better distribution.\n\nFront brake bias is crucial since we're using engine braking more, so increase from 50 to 60%.\n\nEngine Braking: Higher values are better, but Monza might need less because of the track's characteristics.

    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help generate a set of regulations for the Monza circuit based on the given information and examples from Barcelona and Bad intermediate circuits. The user mentioned that Monza is more similar to the Barcelona circuit in terms of its characteristics.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each parameter provided for Barcelona as a starting point since Monza is said to be similar. \n\nStarting with the front wing: Barcelona has 45. Since Monza might have a slightly higher value due to possibly needing more downforce, I'll go with 46.\n\nFor the rear wing, Barcelona uses 31. Given that Monza could benefit from less wing in certain conditions but still needs some downforce for stability, maybe around 28 would be appropriate.\n\nThe differential on throttle is 25 in Barcelona. For Monza, since it's a similar track, I'll keep it at 20 to balance traction and grip without penalizing speed too much.\n\nDifferential off throttle in Barcelona is 20; for Monza, maybe 15 would be better as it allows more traction on the straights but still maintains some grip on curves.\n\nFront camber is -3.5, which seems standard, so I'll keep that. Rear camber is -2.2; since Monza has tighter turns, maybe increasing rear camber slightly to -2.0 would help with lateral stability during cornering.\n\nToe-out in front is 0.0 and in the rear it's also 0.0. Since both circuits have similar handling characteristics, I'll keep them at zero for consistency.\n\nSuspension for front is 36; Monza might need a softer ride to handle the bumps better, so perhaps 45 would be better.\n\nRear suspension is 11 in Barcelona. For Monza, which might prefer more rear end softness, maybe increasing it to 20 makes sense.\n\nFront anti-roll bar is 4, and rear is 2. Both circuits use low values for roll control, so keeping them the same seems appropriate.\n\nFront ride height is 23; Monza might benefit from a slightly lower front to improve aerodynamics without sacrificing ground contact, maybe 18.5 would be better.\n\nRear ride height is 56 in Barcelona. Since Monza could use more rear ground contact for stability in the straights, I'll increase it to 60.0.\n\nBrake pressure front is 100; rear is also 100 as both circuits have similar anti-lift requirements.\n\nFront brake bias is 51 and engine braking is 20. Monza might need a slightly higher brake bias for better traction in the straights, so I'll go with 53 for front brake bias.\n\nTyre pressures: Front left and right are 23.9 each; rear are 20.9 each. Since Monza uses softer suspension, maybe increasing rear pressures to 21.0 would be better for handling cornering without overpressuring the front.\n\nSuspension anti-roll bars seem already correct in the examples provided.\n\nNow, considering all these factors and making sure they fit within the valid ranges specified, I'll compile the new set of regulations.\n</think>\n\nFront Wing: 46  \nRear Wing: 28  \nDifferential On Throttle: 20  \nDifferential Off Throttle: 15  \nFront Camber: -3.5  \nRear Camber: -2.0  \nFront Toe: 0.0  \nRear Toe: 0.0  \nFront Suspension: 45  \nRear Suspension: 20  \nFront Anti-Roll Bar: 4  \nRear Anti-Roll Bar: 2  \nFront Ride Height: 18.5  \nRar Ride Height: 60.0  \nBrake Pressure: 100  \nFront Brake Bias: 53  \nEngine Braking: 20  \nFront Left Tyre Pressure: 24.0  \nFront Right Tyre Pressure: 24.0  \nRear Left Tyre Pressure: 21.0  \nRar Right Tyre Pressure: 21.0"
